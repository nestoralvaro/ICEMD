    "\n",
    "You can download this dataset and save it to your current working directly with the file name housing.csv (update: download data from here).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset describes 13 numerical properties of houses in Boston suburbs and is concerned with modeling the price of houses in those suburbs in thousands of dollars. As such, this is a regression predictive modeling problem. Input attributes include things like crime rate, proportion of nonretail business acres, chemical concentrations and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a well-studied problem in machine learning. It is convenient to work with because all of the input and output attributes are numerical and there are 506 instances to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasonable performance for models evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) are around 20 in squared thousands of dollars (or $4,500 if you take the square root). This is a nice target to aim for with our neural network model."
